Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews ðŸŽ®

Overview

This project leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. It provides flexibility through multiple approaches, including a machine learning model trained on IMDb data and a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face. The project features an interactive user interface for real-time predictions and batch processing.

Features

Data Preprocessing:

Utilizes NLTK for text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.

Converts text data into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.

Machine Learning Models:

A custom-trained Random Forest Classifier for sentiment prediction.

A robust pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for enhanced accuracy.

Model Comparison:

Users can seamlessly switch between the Random Forest model and the Hugging Face transformer for analysis.

Interactive Interface:

Built with Streamlit, offering an intuitive user interface for:

Single review analysis: Input individual movie reviews for quick sentiment analysis.

Batch processing: Upload a file containing multiple reviews to process them in bulk.

GPU/CPU Flexibility:

Automatically detects and utilizes GPU (if available) for faster Hugging Face model predictions. Falls back to CPU when a GPU is not accessible.

Visualization:

Provides sentiment confidence scores and clear visual results.
